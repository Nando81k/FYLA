echo "🎉 Real Booking Service Integration Complete:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "✅ TypeScript compilation: Passed"
echo "✅ Mock data removed: Replaced with real API calls"
echo "✅ Conflict detection: Implemented proper time overlap checking"
echo "✅ Duration blocking: 3-hour appointments block full duration"
echo ""
echo "🔧 API Integration Features:"
echo "• 🌐 Real API endpoints: /api/appointments/*"
echo "• 📊 Time slot availability: Based on actual bookings"
echo "• ⚡ Conflict detection: Prevents overlapping appointments"
echo "• 🕒 Duration blocking: Respects service duration requirements"
echo "• 📝 Service filtering: Time slots filtered by selected services"
echo ""
echo "📱 Updated Components:"
echo "• TimeSlotPicker.tsx: Uses real API data"
echo "• ClientBookingHistory.tsx: Shows actual booked appointments"
echo "• ComprehensiveBookingModal.tsx: Creates real bookings"
echo "• realBookingService.ts: New service with real API integration"
echo ""
echo "🎯 Real Data Features:"
echo "• 📊 Availability Checking:"
echo "  - Fetches real time slots from backend"
echo "  - Considers existing bookings for conflict detection"
echo "  - Filters by selected services and duration"
echo "  - Prevents double-booking during appointment duration"
echo ""
echo "• 🔒 Booking Management:"
echo "  - Creates real appointments in database"
echo "  - Proper status tracking (pending → confirmed → completed)"
echo "  - Real client and provider associations"
echo "  - Service duration and pricing from actual data"
echo ""
echo "• ⏰ Duration Conflict Prevention:"
echo "  - 3-hour appointment blocks: 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM"
echo "  - No other bookings allowed during blocked time"
echo "  - Proper time overlap detection algorithm"
echo "  - Service duration-based slot calculation"

echo "🚀 Example Scenario:"
echo "1. Client A books 3-hour service (2:00 PM - 5:00 PM)"
echo "2. System blocks entire duration in database"
echo "3. Client B tries to book 1-hour service (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM)"
echo "4. System detects conflict and shows slot as unavailable"
echo "5. Client B must choose non-conflicting time slot"

echo ""
echo "Ready for testing with real appointment data!"
echo "• Time slots reflect actual provider availability"
echo "• Bookings create real database entries"
echo "• Conflict detection prevents scheduling issues"
echo "• Duration-based blocking ensures proper time management"
