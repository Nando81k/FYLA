## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Mock Data
- ❌ Eliminated all `generateMock*` methods

## Key Features Now Working

1. **Time Slot Availability**: Based on actual provider schedules and existing bookings
2. **Conflict Detection**: Prevents overlapping appointments automatically
3. **Duration-Aware Booking**: Long services block appropriate time spans
4. **Real-Time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately across all clients
5. **Status Management**: Pending → Confirmed → Completed workflow

## API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/appointments/time-slots?providerId={id}&date={date}&serviceIds={ids}`
- `POST /api/appointments` - Create booking
- `PATCH /api/appointments/{id}` - Update status
- `GET /api/appointments` - User's appointments

## Testing Ready

The system now uses live data and proper conflict prevention. No more mock responses!
